///////////ONLY CHANGE CODE BELOW THIS LINE//////////////////////////////////////
/*
You're looking to paint your room, so you order some supplies: paint and a brush. The problem is, we take the job seriously and will only start painting after we’ve mixed the paint. But the way our code is currently written, we’re not sure which callback will run first. That’s a major problem.

Structure the code below in a way that ensures this line:

"Neon Green Paint received, time to mix it!"

Will ALWAYS log to the console before this line:

Horsehair brush received, time to start painting!

*/

function printItem(item){
  console.log(`${item.product} received, time to ${item.directions()}`);
}

orderSupplies('paint', function(item){
  printItem(item);
  orderSupplies('brush', function(item){
    printItem(item);
  });
});
