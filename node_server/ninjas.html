    <P>
      In Japanese, the plural for ninja is ninja. However, in the Americanization is ninjas. Since pluralization is one of the few instances where we still hold on to case endings, the -s ending means quite a bit to English speakers. But I think that if someone said "Joey was attacked by nine ninja."
